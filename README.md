Can We Use Weather Related Data To Predict Hourly Market Energy Demand?

1) For the sake of this preliminary project, we assumed that Market Energy Demand is dependant on various factors, including historical Market Energy Demand, Seasonality, Time of Day, Temperature, Wind Speed, Humidity, etc.
2) The data that we used for this analysis was saved into the csv file which can be read and accessed via Microsoft Excel
3) For the duration of this project, it was not determined feasible to create a UI. For this reason, data was extracted and written into an excel file, where Vlookup is used to compare the Actual vs Predictable results
